Machine Learning Topics :
1. Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forests
4. Ensmeble Leaning Methods
5. Clustering
6. Dimensionality Redcution
7. Support Vector Machines
8. Boosting ALgorithms
9. Bias-Variance
10. Evalutation Metrics (precision, recall, F1, ROC Curve, AOC score)
11. Recomendation Engine
12. Forecasting
13. Text Mining
14. Overfitting and Hyperparameter tunning
But want to Learns more if an oppurtunity has been given.
